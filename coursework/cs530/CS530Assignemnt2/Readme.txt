Learning Outcome:
After doing this project first of all it taught me to full grasp the topic of the project fully before attempting to do anything. Furthermore it taught me to do the project as early as possible because there are many test cases. Most importantly, it taught me the important job that compilers today have, as in this project we are only dealing with logical operators and relational operators as well as ints. In Programming there are assignment variables as well as signed and unsigned integers and many more to account for.
